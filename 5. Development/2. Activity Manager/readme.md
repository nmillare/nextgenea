Welcome to the Engagement Planner/NextGen EA Platform



The ‘Engagement Planner/NexGen EA Platform’ offers a simplified and logical approach to guidance EA’s to engage on Value Added Activities while working with assigned customers in the Regions. 

The ‘Engagement Planner’ has a modularization approach to provide Activity Sections based on the EA activity needs to support customers Business Transformation requirements.
