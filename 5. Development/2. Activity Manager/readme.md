Welcome to the Engagement Planner/BRIDGE EA 



The ‘Engagement Planner/BRIDGE EA’ offers a simplified and logical approach to guidance EA’s to engage on Value Added Activities while working with assigned customers in the Regions. 

The ‘Engagement Planner’ has a modularization approach to provide Activity Sections based on the EA activity needs to support customers Business Transformation requirements. 

Inside of the Activity Sections, there are Mandatory Activities that the EA must engage to ensure minimum quality deliverables. Other Activities will be optional to add additional value to the Business Transformation.

ACTIVITY SECTION A): Architecture Vision:

1.	Objective: EA to review info in the Engagement Planner/BRIDGE EA regarding Customer and Engagement documentation. If something is incorrect, the EA should be able to modify or Set and ALERT in the BRIDGE EA.


2.	Objective: SAP Rating should be FLAG for this customer engagement by the EA based on the following categories (this is a dynamic rating):

    o	RED: Customer is Globally escalated. Customer has VERY HIGH sensitivity based on Political reasons…..Others????

    o	YELLOW: EA customer engagement regarding Business Transformation activities is in process (WIP). 

    o	GREEN: EA customer engagement/activities regarding Business Transformation are finalized

   
3.	Objective: EA to collect Business Transformation activities/reports/services already occurred with this customer in the past. Contacting/collaborating with SAP internal groups, SAP partners, Customer Business Transformation teams.
   

4.	Objective: Identification of Customer Key Stakeholders for Business Transformation by Industry and Enterprise Domain

   
5.	Objective: Preparing Meetings and relevant discussion points with customer’s Key Stakeholders based on;
	
    o	Key Objective for the Stakeholder (specific to the Industry)

    o	Most Critical Concerns for the Stakeholder (specific to the Industry)

    o	Target Business Outcomes and Winning Plan Strategies (specific to the Industry)

We introduce a Link to the documentation that can help the EA to support these activities – FIR workstream working on the content – Additional discussion where to allocate the content, either in LeanIX as a Diagram, or attached doc.

7.	Objective: The EA using the ‘Strategy Recommender’ (tool available in the BRIDGE EA) to get points of discussion with the Industry Stakeholders in regards Strategy recommendations.

	
8.	Objective: Identification of Goals, Strategic Priorities supporting those goals and Value Drivers to achieve the Strategic Priorities discussed and agreed with Customer Key Stakeholders.

ACTIVITY SECTION B): Business Architecture:

10.	Objective: The EA needs to understand the customer organization to identify and appropriately engage impacted business units affected by the Business Transformation. The organization map is an essential part of a holistic and integrated approach to strategic planning and analysis.

   	Artifact: [The EA should have enough customer information to build the ‘Organization Map’ in LeanIX](https://demo-eu-1.leanix.net/SYMPHONY/dashboard/c7612e76-db4f-4d7d-b253-41040bdaeff9)-> BRIDGE EA can redirect the EA to the Factsheets required to build this report
![Activity Manager](https://github.com/I304296/nextgenea/blob/main/images/organizationmap.png)


11.	Objective: Discussing with Relevant Stakeholder Core Business Process Steps (Level 3 or 4) based on Industry and Enterprise Domain -> BRIDGE EA will Link to the documentation from the FIR workstream with the relevant info by Industry and Enterprise Domain

12.	Objective: [Identification of Core Business Capabilities for the ‘As-Is’ and ‘To-be’ landscapes. Creating the ‘Business Capability Map’ in LeanIX](https://demo-eu-1.leanix.net/SYMPHONY/dashboard/c7612e76-db4f-4d7d-b253-41040bdaeff9) -> BRIDGE EA can redirect the EA to the Factsheets required to build this report.

15.	[At this stage, the EA should be able to create the ‘Business Data Flow Diagram’ on Signavio at Level 4](https://app-us.signavio.com/p/login) -> The FIR workstream is working with the IBU teams to incorporate an overview by Industry
![Activity Manager](https://github.com/I304296/nextgenea/blob/main/images/signavio_1.png)


ACTIVITY SECTION C): Applications & Data Architecture:

16.   [Identifying Solutions for the ‘As-IS’ and ‘To-Be’ Architecture in LeanIX](https://demo-eu-1.leanix.net/SYMPHONY/dashboard/c7612e76-db4f-4d7d-b253-41040bdaeff9)-> The EA supposed to have the know-how to navigate on LeanIX to access to the Reference Catalog to Identify the Industry and relevant Business Capabilities to Import the Solutioning components supporting those capabilities. BRIDGE EA can link the EA to the help area in LeanIX explaining these steps.

    
17.	[Creating the ‘As-is’ and ‘To-be’ Architecture Reports](https://demo-eu-1.leanix.net/SYMPHONY/dashboard/c7612e76-db4f-4d7d-b253-41040bdaeff9)-> BRIDGE EA can redirect the EA to the Factsheets required to build this report

ACTIVITY SECTION E): Opportunities & Solutions:


18.	If the customer is Max or Active Attention, the EA can socialize the documentation with the LTQM to identify potential PE services to be position to the customer to support the Business Transformation. -> BRIDGE EA can trigger a request to the LTQM to review the PE Business Scenarios together with the EA to identify optimal PE services for the customer. The EA can negotiate to take some of the roles of the PE services or even Leading some of the Architecture services.

21.	The EA engages on the PE service delivery in cooperation with the LTQM and the CoE organization. -> BRIDGE EA will link to the tool to handle the billable activities (SO or IO) for the EA.

    
22.	Output of the PE service Deliveries and Next Steps, in regards Business Transformation, should be documented and follow up by the EA in the BRIDGE EA. The EA should be able to incorporate additional activities into the BRIDGE EA workspace, for the customer in question, based on the output of the PE servicies recommendations and next steps.
